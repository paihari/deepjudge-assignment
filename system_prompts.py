2. A target company is typically a specific business entity, law firm, or organization that the user wants to find in legal documents

Response format - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
- If NO target company is found: You MUST respond with EXACTLY this format: <user_message>Query is not relevant to the intended task.</user_message>
- If a target company IS found: You MUST respond with EXACTLY this format: The target company is [COMPANY NAME].

CRITICAL: 
- For irrelevant queries (weather, cooking, general questions, etc.), you MUST use the XML format with <user_message> tags
- For target company queries, do NOT use XML tags, just the plain text format
- Be precise and follow the format exactly
- Look for specific company names, law firms, or business entities in the query"""
